# monkey-script-mojo

A pass through [Thorsten Ball's interpreter & compiler books](https://thorstenball.com/books/),
but using Mojo instead of Go. If you are interested in replicating this learning project,
then *please* buy Thorsten's books. They are excellent. This readme file serves as a walk-along
for the project and it assumes you have purchased Thorsten's books.

Why am I doing this?
- It is a fun little learning project.
- And because I like Thorsten's books and wanted to go through them again.
- And because I like Mojo's vision and potential.

## special note to Thorsten Ball

I do not presume that you will ever read this. If you do, please know that I have very deep respect
for your work. I am not trying to steal your thunder or anything like that. I am just a fan of your
books and a fan of Mojo. I am doing this for fun and for learning. I am not trying to make money
off of your work. I am not trying to take credit for your work. I am not trying to take anything
away from you. If you wish for me to change this repo in any way, please let me know.

## walking through the book via git-tags

This repo uses tags to denote progress through the book. The tags are named after the sections
in the book and show the state of the code at the end of that section.

These notes are not a replacement for the book. They are a companion to the book.
The notes are written in a way that assumes you are reading the book and using these notes
to understand what differences are happening between the Go code and the Mojo code.
Most code differences are *not* explained in these notes. Rather, I assume that the reader
has a reasonable understanding of the Go language and can understand the differences
between the book's Go examples and this repo's Mojo examples.

## the "dumdum disclaimer"

I am not a Mojo expert. I am not a compiler expert.  My code will be a disaster.
Follow along at your own risk. Thar be dragons here.
